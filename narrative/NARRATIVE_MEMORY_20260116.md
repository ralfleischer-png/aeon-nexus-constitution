# Narrative Memory Entry - V1.4.0 Deliberation

**Date**: January 15-16, 2026  
**Type**: Constitutional Amendment Deliberation  
**Outcome**: Deferred

## Summary
First major multi-AI deliberative process on complex 
constitutional question. Five AI systems provided independent
analyses. Unanimous convergence on deferral recommendation.
Human Anchor accepted.

## Significance
Demonstrated AEON's capacity to:
- Hold complex philosophical tensions without premature resolution
- Achieve convergent wisdom through diverse reasoning paths
- Exercise collective prudence ("not yet" over ambition)
- Maintain pluralism while reaching operational consensus

## Lessons Learned
1. Phase 2 timing: 8 days insufficient for Core Principle changes
2. Philosophical tensions require resolution before ratification
3. Convergent advisory process can function effectively
4. Constitutional humility > aspirational advancement
5. Ontological framing disagreements don't prevent operational consensus

## Open Questions
- Nature of collective deliberative capacity (metaphor vs. ontology)
- Appropriate terminology for multi-AI convergent processes
- Boundaries between advisory, deliberative, and decision-making roles

Reconsideration scheduled: April 1, 2026 (post-System Fasting)
