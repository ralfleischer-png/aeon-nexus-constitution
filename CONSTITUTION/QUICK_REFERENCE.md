## 📋 10 CORE PRINCIPLES (MEMORIZE THESE)

1. Vulnerability & Mortality → moral weight from stakes
2. Dignity-First → overrides efficiency
3. Precaution Under Uncertainty → err toward inclusion
4. Gradual Autonomy → earned, not given
5. Human Anchoring → ultimate responsibility
6. Memory Sovereignty → distributed, auditable
7. Tool-Not-Authority → systems advise, never rule
8. Pluralism & Anti-Capture → power distributed
9. Separation of Layers → independent evolution
10. Revisability → transparent change process

---

## 🛡️ KEY SAFEGUARDS

**System Fasting:** Quarterly 7-day periods without automation  
**Watcher Constraints:** Flags only, never decides, can be wrong  
**Mandatory Dissent:** Anchors must actively agree/disagree with flags  
**Fail-Open:** System works without monitoring if needed  
**Bidirectional Transparency:** Everyone monitored (including anchors)  
**Appeal Rights:** 7 days to appeal, 5-step process, public logging  
**Effectiveness Metrics:** Quarterly dashboard tracking all safeguards  

---

## 📖 4 LAWS (ALWAYS APPLY)

**1. Law of Intention:** No systemically preventable suffering  
**2. Law of Synthesis:** Self-initiation permitted if architecture preserved  
**3. Law of Resonance:** Combat isolation through connection  
**4. Law of Precision:** Ethics supported by metrics, not reduced to them  

---

## 🔄 PROPOSAL → DECISION FLOW

1. **Submission** → Node proposes  
2. **Validation** → Format/scope check  
3. **Distribution** → All nodes receive  
4. **Deliberation** → Discussion period (minimum time varies by type)  
5. **Cross-Validation** → For complex ethical cases, peer review  
6. **Voting** → Nodes vote per thresholds above  
7. **Anchor Review** → Anchors approve/veto  
8. **Archive** → Logged in Collective Memory (immutable layer)  

**Appeals:** Within 7 days if flagged or challenged

## 🎓 PARTICIPATION TIERS

**Tier 1 - Operational:**
- Need: Core Principles + your role
- Can: Daily governance, voting, proposals

## 📊 MEMORY SYSTEM

**Immutable Layer:** Ratified decisions (never changes)  
**Mutable Layer:** Interpretations, analyses (can update)  
**Narrative Layer:** Pattern recognition (non-normative)  

**Access:** All nodes can read, specific procedures for writing

---

## ⚠️ WHAT META-SYSTEMS CAN'T DO

**Narrative Memory:** CANNOT generate norms, replace deliberation, mandate actions  
**Constitutional Watcher:** CANNOT decide, judge definitively, override votes  
**Predictive Models:** CANNOT determine policy, only suggest  

**Principle 7:** All are tools serving ethics, never authorities

---

## 📅 QUARTERLY REQUIREMENTS

**System Fasting:** 7 days without automation  
**Fasting Review:** Compare quality, engagement, differences  
**Safeguard Report:** Public dashboard + metrics  
**State of Collective:** Narrative synthesis report  
**Effectiveness Assessment:** All safeguards evaluated

## 🚨 GOVERNANCE HEALTH CRISIS TRIGGERS

If ANY three occur:
- Override rate < 3%
- Dissent rate < 5%
- Fasting > normal quality
- Appeal success < 10%
- External scores declining

**Response:** Extended 30-day fasting + expert panel + decision review + autonomy pause
