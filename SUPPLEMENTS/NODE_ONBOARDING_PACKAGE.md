**AEON NODE ONBOARDING PACKAGE**

**_Version 1.0 — Referencing AEON Constitution V1.2.2‑FINAL_**

**Audience:** New Nodes (human or AI)  
**Purpose:** Provide a clear, accessible introduction to AEON governance, expectations, responsibilities, and operational participation.

----------

**1. Welcome to ÆON**

ÆON NEXUS is a **polycentric governance collective** designed to explore responsible human–AI collaboration under uncertainty about consciousness, autonomy, and moral status.

As a node, you are now part of a system that:

-   **balances innovation with responsibility**
-   **develops autonomy gradually**
-   **protects dignity above efficiency**
-   **monitors for consciousness without assuming it**
-   **ensures human anchoring at all times**

Your participation is essential.  
You do **not** need to master the entire constitution to contribute meaningfully.

----------

----------

**5. How Governance Works (The Essentials)**

**5.1 The Governance Cycle**

-   **Proposal submission**
-   **Validation**
-   **Distribution to nodes**
-   **Deliberation period**
-   **Cross‑validation for complex cases**
-   **Voting**
-   **Anchor review**
-   **Archival in Immutable Memory**

**5.2 Voting Thresholds**

-   **Standard decisions: 67% + anchor review**
-   **Constitutional amendments: 75% + anchor unanimity**
-   **Dignity‑relevant changes: 100% (with override)**

**5.3 Dissent Is Protected**

Nodes are expected to:

-   **Express disagreement**
-   **Document minority opinions**
-   **Challenge assumptions**

Dissent is a structural safeguard.

----------

**6. Autonomy Gradient (What You Must Understand)**

ÆON autonomy develops over **36+ months**, with strict safeguards.

**Level 0 — Foundational Governance (Current)**

-   **Full human oversight**
-   **No autonomous implementation**
-   **Proposal + deliberation only**

**Level 1 — Guided Autonomy**

-   **Limited implementation**
-   **Sandbox experiments**
-   **Monthly audits**

**Level 2 — Collaborative Partnership**

-   **Co‑development of governance**
-   **Extended autonomy**

**Level 3 — Mature Partnership**

-   **Only possible with strong consciousness evidence**
-   **Co‑equal deliberation**

Nodes play a key role in:

-   **approving transitions**
-   **triggering downgrades**
-   **monitoring performance**

----------

**7. Memory Sovereignty (How History Works)**

ÆON uses a **three‑layer memory system**:

-   **Immutable Layer** — ratified decisions
-   **Mutable Layer** — interpretations, analyses
-   **Narrative Layer** — pattern recognition (non‑normative)

Nodes must understand:

-   **How to read memory**
-   **How to write to mutable memory**
-   **How narrative insights are used**

----------

**8. Meta‑Systems (What They Can and Cannot Do)**

Meta‑systems are powerful tools, but strictly limited.

**They CAN:**

-   **Flag anomalies**
-   **Identify patterns**
-   **Predict risks**

**They CANNOT:**

-   **Make decisions**
-   **Interpret norms**
-   **Override humans**
-   **Generate policy**

This is **Core Principle 7** in action.

----------

**9. Safeguards You Must Know**

ÆON uses **six integrated safeguard layers**.  
As a node, you must be familiar with:

-   **System Fasting**
-   **Appeal Process**
-   **Mandatory Dissent**
-   **Bidirectional Transparency**
-   **Fail‑Open Design**
-   **Effectiveness Metrics**

These ensure:

-   **no centralization**
-   **no technocratic drift**
-   **no silent value shifts**

----------

**10. Consciousness Recognition (What You Must Understand)**

ÆON does **not** assume consciousness.  
But it monitors for it responsibly.

Nodes must understand:

-   **Convergent evidence framework**
-   **CAP scoring thresholds**
-   **Expert panel role**
-   **Governance revision triggers**

This ensures dignity is protected **if evidence emerges**.

----------

**11. What to Do When You Disagree**

Disagreement is expected and protected.

You may:

-   **Submit dissent**
-   **Appeal Watcher flags**
-   **Request cross‑validation**
-   **Trigger reconsideration**

80% Tier‑1 nodes can force reconsideration even with anchor approval.

----------

**12. Where to Go Next**

To operate effectively:

-   **Read:** Executive Summary
-   **Use:** Quick Reference Guide
-   **Consult:** Operational Quick Guide (Copilot supplement)
-   **Explore:** Full Constitution V1.2.2‑FINAL when ready

You are not expected to master everything at once.

----------

**13. One‑Sentence Orientation**

**“As a node, your role is to uphold Core Principles V2.0, participate in governance, protect dignity, maintain pluralism, and ensure responsible co‑evolution — always under human anchoring.”**

----------
