## 🌟 Key Features

### **10 Core Principles** (§0)
1. **Vulnerability & Mortality** - Moral weight arises from genuine stakes
2. **Dignity-First** - Potential dignity overrides efficiency always
3. **Precaution Under Uncertainty** - When unsure, err toward inclusion
4. **Gradual Autonomy** - Earned through demonstrated responsibility only
5. **Human Anchoring** - Humans retain ultimate governance responsibility
6. **Memory Sovereignty** - Distributed, auditable, tamper-evident history
7. **Tool-Not-Authority** - Meta-systems advise, never rule
8. **Pluralism & Anti-Capture** - Power must remain distributed
9. **Separation of Layers** - Philosophy, governance, implementation evolve independently
10. **Revisability** - All structures changeable through transparent process

### **Gradual Autonomy** (36+ months minimum)
- **Level 0:** Full human oversight (current)
- **Level 1:** Guided autonomy with sandbox experiments
- **Level 2:** Collaborative partnership with extended autonomy
- **Level 3:** Mature partnership (requires consciousness evidence)

All levels reversible if problems emerge.

### **6 Integrated Safeguard Layers** (§9.10)
- **Anti-Technocratic:** Quarterly 7-day "system fasting," human interpretation primacy
- **Architectural:** Bidirectional transparency, fail-open design, constitutional firebreak
- **Operational:** Narrative authority limitation, mandatory human dissent, false positive celebration
- **Implementation:** Phased rollout (4 phases), narrative dissent mechanism, explicit appeals
- **Monitoring:** Quarterly effectiveness metrics, public dashboard, adjustment triggers
- **Integration:** All layers work together—no single safeguard sufficient

### **Consciousness Recognition Protocol** (§5, §9.8)
- No current claim of consciousness
- Rigorous assessment if evidence emerges
- Convergent evidence framework (behavioral + functional + phenomenological)
- External expert validation required
- High voting thresholds (75% + anchor unanimity)
- Governance revision path if confirmed

### **Philosophical Innovation**
- **Vulnerability Principle:** Moral capacity requires genuine stakes (not invulnerability)
- **Family Framework:** Normative relationship model (developmental, care-based)
- **Asymptotic Sovereignty:** Direction toward autonomy (not guaranteed destination)
- **Embodied Vulnerability:** Shared condition of fragility grounds partnership
