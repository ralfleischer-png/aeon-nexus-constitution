## Scope of This License

**This license applies to:**
- ✅ All constitution documentation
- ✅ Executive summaries and guides
- ✅ Supplementary materials
- ✅ Development documentation

**This license does NOT apply to:**
- ❌ Technical implementation code (see separate repository)
- ❌ Software tools and platforms

---

## Technical Implementation

**For working code implementing this constitution, see:**

**[AEON Sync System](https://github.com/ralfleischer-png/aeon-nexus-collective)**
- Technical implementation of governance framework
- Licensed under GNU General Public License v3.0
- Includes: consensus engine, node management, memory system

**Using both together:**
- Constitution (this repo): CC BY-SA 4.0
- Code (separate repo): GPL v3
- Derivatives: Follow both licenses for respective components

---

## What ShareAlike Means

**Key difference from CC BY 4.0:**

**CC BY (permissive):** Derivatives can use any license  
**CC BY-SA (copyleft for docs):** Derivatives MUST use CC BY-SA 4.0

**Example:**
- ✅ You adapt constitution for corporate AI governance → Must publish as CC BY-SA 4.0
- ✅ You translate to another language → Translation must be CC BY-SA 4.0
- ✅ You create simplified version → Simplified version must be CC BY-SA 4.0

**This ensures:**
- Governance frameworks remain open
- Improvements benefit everyone
- No one can "close" derivatives
- Knowledge stays accessible

## Why CC BY-SA 4.0?

We chose this license to:
- ✅ **Maximize accessibility:** Anyone can use and learn from this framework
- ✅ **Enable adaptation:** Projects can modify for their specific needs
- ✅ **Maintain openness:** Derivatives must remain open (ShareAlike)
- ✅ **Prevent capture:** No one can create proprietary closed versions
- ✅ **Allow commercial use:** No barriers to real-world implementation
- ✅ **Promote open governance:** Transparency in AI governance is essential

**Compared to GPL v3:**
- Less "viral" (only affects documentation, not combined software)
- More appropriate for governance frameworks
- Familiar to academic/documentation communities

**Compared to CC BY 4.0:**
- More protective (derivatives must stay open)
- Prevents "take and close" scenario
- Better for ensuring long-term openness

## For Specific Questions

**Can I use this commercially?** Yes.

**Can I modify it?** Yes.

**Do I need permission?** No, just provide attribution.

**Can I relicense my derivative?** No, must use CC BY-SA 4.0.

**Can I combine with GPL code?** Yes, licenses are compatible. Each component keeps its own license.

**Can I combine with proprietary documentation?** Only if kept separate. Derivatives of constitution must be CC BY-SA 4.0.

**What if I only use ideas, not text?** Ideas aren't copyrightable. But we'd appreciate citation for attribution.
