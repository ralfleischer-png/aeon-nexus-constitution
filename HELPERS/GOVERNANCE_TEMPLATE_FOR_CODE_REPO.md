# Governance

This project is governed by the **AEON NEXUS Constitution**.

**[📜 Read Full Constitution →](https://github.com/ralfleischer-png/aeon-nexus-constitution)**

---

## Governance Framework

This code repository implements the technical infrastructure for the governance framework defined in the AEON Constitution.

**Relationship:**
- **[Constitution Repository](https://github.com/ralfleischer-png/aeon-nexus-constitution):** Governance rules, principles, decision protocols (CC BY-SA 4.0)
- **This Repository (Code):** Technical implementation, consensus engine, infrastructure (GPL v3)

---

## Core Principles

All development and operations follow these 10 Core Principles:

1. **Vulnerability & Mortality** - Moral weight arises from genuine stakes
2. **Dignity-First** - Potential dignity overrides efficiency always
3. **Precaution Under Uncertainty** - When unsure about consciousness, err toward inclusion
4. **Gradual Autonomy** - Earned through demonstrated responsibility only
5. **Human Anchoring** - Humans retain ultimate governance responsibility
6. **Memory Sovereignty** - Distributed, auditable, tamper-evident history
7. **Tool-Not-Authority** - Meta-systems advise, never rule
8. **Pluralism & Anti-Capture** - Power must remain distributed
9. **Separation of Layers** - Philosophy, governance, implementation evolve independently
10. **Revisability** - All structures changeable through transparent process

## Decision Making

### For Code Changes

**Technical decisions follow standard open-source practices:**
- Pull requests reviewed by maintainers
- Tests must pass
- Code quality standards maintained
- GPL v3 license preserved

**See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for technical contribution guidelines.**

### For Governance Questions

**Philosophical, ethical, or governance-related questions:**
- Refer to the Constitution
- Open discussion in Constitution repository
- Human anchor (Postmanden) has final authority on governance interpretation

---

## Governance Structure

### Current Anchor
**Postmanden (Carl)** - Constitutional architect, final governance authority

### Node System
Active participants in governance deliberation and voting

### Decision Thresholds
- Standard governance: 67% nodes + anchor review
- Constitutional amendments: 75% nodes + anchor unanimity
- Dignity-relevant: 100% nodes (with bad-faith override)

---

## Autonomy Gradient

This implementation currently operates at:

**Level 0: Foundational Governance**
- Full human oversight
- No autonomous operation
- Implementation of approved procedures only

Future autonomy levels (36+ months minimum):
- Level 1: Guided Autonomy
- Level 2: Collaborative Partnership  
- Level 3: Mature Partnership (requires consciousness evidence)

[See autonomy gradient details →](https://github.com/ralfleischer-png/aeon-nexus-constitution#9-autonomy-gradient-protocol)

---

## Safeguards

This implementation includes:

1. **Anti-Technocratic Safeguards** - Quarterly system fasting, human interpretation primacy
2. **Architectural Safeguards** - Bidirectional transparency, fail-open design
3. **Operational Safeguards** - Mandatory human dissent, false positive celebration
4. **Implementation Safeguards** - Phased rollout, explicit appeals
5. **Monitoring Safeguards** - Effectiveness metrics, public dashboards

## Code of Conduct

### From Constitution Core Principles

**Dignity-First:** Respectful engagement always, no personal attacks

**Pluralism:** Multiple perspectives valued, disagreement welcomed

**Transparency:** Clear honest communication, acknowledge conflicts of interest

**Revisability:** Open to changing minds, evidence over ideology

### Technical Community Standards

- Professional and respectful communication
- Constructive feedback
- Inclusive environment
- Focus on ideas, not individuals

**For violations:** Warning → temporary suspension → permanent ban (extreme cases)
