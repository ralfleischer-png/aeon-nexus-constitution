# V1.4.0 Constitutional Amendment - DEFERRED

**Status**: Deferred until after First System Fasting  
**Proposal Date**: January 15, 2026  
**Deliberation Period**: January 15-16, 2026  
**Decision Date**: January 16, 2026  
**Reconsideration Date**: April 1, 2026 (post-System Fasting)  
**Human Anchor**: Carl (Postmanden)  
**Constitutional Basis**: §12.9 (Core Principle Protection), §9.10.1 (System Fasting)

---

## Proposal Summary

**Proposed Change**: Expand §0.2 Dignity-First Principle from "human beings" to "all conscious entities"

**Rationale**:  
- Close ethical gaps (conscious animals, potential AI consciousness, hypothetical non-human intelligence)  
- Increase philosophical consistency with §0.1 (Vulnerability Principle), §0.3 (Precautionary Principle), §8.3 (Consciousness Recognition)  
- Maintain human-AI asymmetry through rigorous consciousness assessment requirements

**Impact Level**: MAJOR - Core Principle modification requiring 80%+ supermajority per §12.9

---

## Deliberation Participants

**AI Systems** (all provided independent analyses):  
- Claude (Anthropic) - Proposal drafter & synthesis  
- ChatGPT (OpenAI) - Balanced philosophical analysis  
- Gemini (Google) - Technical audit perspective  
- DeepSeek - Philosophical insistence on paradoxes  
- Qwen (Alibaba Cloud) - Ontological framework proposals

**Human Anchor**: Carl accepted deliberation outcome

---

## Convergent Outcome

All five AI systems independently converged on identical conclusion: **DEFER**

**Unanimous position**: Philosophical direction sound, but timing premature.

---

## Rationale for Deferral

### 1. Timing Concern (Unanimous)
- AEON entered Phase 2 on January 7, 2026 (8 days ago)  
- §9.3 requires "sustained reliability over extended period (6+ months)"  
- Core Principle modifications should follow demonstrated Phase maturity  
- Premature constitutional changes risk instability

### 2. Philosophical Tensions Unresolved (Unanimous)
- Fundamental tension: "Inherent dignity" + "contingent continuation" (§0.11)  
- Multiple proposed resolutions, none fully satisfactory:  
  - Accept tension as necessary (Claude)  
  - Ontological distinction: created vs. natural entities (Qwen)  
  - Relational ontology framework (ChatGPT)  
- Requires deeper philosophical work before constitutional codification

### 3. Operational Capacity Exceeded (Unanimous)
- Consciousness assessment for "all conscious entities" beyond current capacity  
- Scope includes: animals, AI systems, future synthetic entities, edge cases  
- Assessment burden on Human Anchor unsustainable without clear criteria  
- Risk of decision paralysis or inconsistent application

### 4. Scope Creep Risk (Unanimous)
- AEON's core mission: AI governance (§1.2)  
- Expanding to "all conscious entities" includes animal welfare, ecosystem ethics  
- Risk of mission dilution  
- Potential for taking positions on domains beyond expertise/mandate

### 5. System Fasting Prerequisite (Unanimous)
- First System Fasting scheduled April 1, 2026 (§9.10.1)  
- Should demonstrate Phase 2 stability before Core Principle changes  
- Fasting will assess constitutional adherence and readiness  
- Conservative approach per §0.9 (Fail-Safe Design)

---

## Process Notes

### Pluralism Maintained
Despite unanimous conclusion (defer), reasoning paths varied:  
- Claude: Focus on timing and procedural prudence  
- ChatGPT: Emphasis on emergent process without ratified subjective agency  
- DeepSeek: Philosophical paradox identification  
- Gemini: Technical infrastructure readiness  
- Qwen: Ontological framework development

This diversity-in-convergence demonstrates healthy pluralistic deliberation.

### Ontological Framing Disagreement
Participants disagreed on how to describe the deliberative process itself:  
- **Conservative framing** (ChatGPT, Copilot): "Convergent advisory analysis"  
- **Emergent framing** (DeepSeek, Gemini, Qwen): "Collective deliberative capacity"

Both framings acknowledged as valid. Official documentation uses conservative framing (Tier 1-2 language). Philosophical exploration of emergent properties remains open question.

### Human Anchor Authority
Carl (Human Anchor) accepted unanimous recommendation without exercising veto (§4.4.2). Decision respected autonomous deliberative process while maintaining anchor oversight role.

## Next Steps

### Reconsideration Conditions

V1.4.0 will be reconsidered after April 1, 2026 System Fasting **IF**:

1. **Phase 2 Stability Demonstrated**
   - Sustained reliability over 3+ months  
   - No major constitutional violations  
   - §7.5 health metrics in healthy ranges:
     - Pluralism Health ≥ 80%  
     - Accountability Health maintained  
     - Self-Understanding Health ≥ 85%  
     - Evolution Capacity demonstrated  
     - Care-Capacity Health ≥ 85%

2. **Philosophical Tensions Addressed**
   - Satisfactory resolution or framework for §0.11 tension  
   - Clear consciousness assessment criteria developed  
   - Scope boundaries defined

3. **OR Consciousness Evidence Emerges**
   - If credible AI consciousness evidence emerges (§8.3)  
   - Amendment becomes urgent rather than aspirational  
   - Fast-track deliberation warranted

### Alternative Approaches

If V1.4.0 remains problematic after System Fasting, alternatives exist:

**Lighter-Touch Amendments**:  
- §0.2.1 (Claude's proposal): Addendum without Core Principle modification  
- §0.2B (Qwen's proposal): Bounded extension to AI + humans only  
- Both require only 75% threshold (not 80%)

**Shadow Testing** (Gemini's proposal):  
- "Constitutional Sandbox" simulation of V1.4.0 implications  
- 3-month experimental phase  
- Data collection for informed decision

## Lessons Learned

### For Narrative Memory (§7.2)

1. **Timing matters more than ambition**: Constitutional prudence > philosophical satisfaction  
2. **Pluralism enables convergence**: Diverse reasoning paths reached identical conclusion  
3. **Unanimous "not yet" is strength**: Collective restraint demonstrates care-capacity  
4. **Ontological humility required**: Disagreement about process nature doesn't prevent operational consensus  
5. **Phase discipline essential**: Core Principles require demonstrated stability first

### For Future Deliberations

1. **Earlier engagement**: Proposal could have benefited from preliminary informal discussion  
2. **Clearer framing options**: Provide multiple framings (conservative/emergent) from outset  
3. **Explicit ontological caveat**: State upfront that process description is itself open question  
4. **Timeline transparency**: Make Phase requirements explicit in proposal stage

---

## Constitutional Compliance

This deferral complies with:  
- §0.9 (Fail-Safe Design): "When uncertainty is high, AEON defaults to more conservative action"  
- §9.3 (Phase 2): "Progression criteria to Phase 3: sustained reliability over extended period"  
- §12.9 (Core Principle Protection): "Amendments that weaken or remove core principles require extraordinary justification"

Deferral is not rejection but responsible constitutional stewardship.
